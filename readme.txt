To create an app from which a parent can completely incapacitate its childs phone during child's study hours... the possiblities
----> can be either to get root access
----> parent can reset password to screen of child's phone
      * the app will be having an inteface that can get the parent to get inside the child's phone and go to settings
        and change passwords and other activities.
        (The only problem is to make that app so that phone can be accessed and opened by parents via there phones)
      * the app should take record of screen locks and security privilages.  
----> parents can schedule phone incapacitaions as they want..
---->during incapacitaion periods children can only call to certain contacts or get calls from them(including parents).
---->there is an app that gives control transfer from one system to another using gui study it and check feasibility 
     of its implementations.
     
Make the app for tracking location of there children when they are out of homes
----> google maps can be very helpful, since parents can completely access their child's phone they can turn location onn.
----> machine learning and deep learning techniques can easily detect misbehaviour in child's location and inform parent.
---->
